# Sniptail Cloud (Hosted & Managed) and FAQ

## Sniptail Cloud (Hosted & Managed)

We are building **Sniptail Cloud**, a hosted and managed version of Sniptail for teams that want the benefits of Sniptail without operating the underlying infrastructure.

Sniptail Cloud is intended to provide:

- A **hosted Slack / Discord bot**
- Managed job coordination (queues, state, retries)
- A web dashboard for configuration, usage, and history
- Optional **fully managed workers** (no servers to run)
- Upgrades, monitoring, and operational reliability handled for you

Sniptail Cloud is currently under active development and is **not yet publicly available**.

## Source-available vs Cloud

Sniptail is designed to be usable in multiple ways.

- The **core Sniptail engine** (bot, worker, agents, integrations) is source-available, self-hostable, and free to use and modify under the Elastic License v2.
- **Sniptail Cloud** (in development) will add a managed control plane, hosted bots, and optional managed execution.

When Sniptail Cloud becomes available, teams will be able to:
- self-host everything
- use a hosted bot while running their own workers
- or use a fully managed setup with no self-hosted components

Self-hosting will remain a supported and valid way to run Sniptail.

## Starting Open, Moving to Cloud (Later)

Teams may start by self-hosting Sniptail and later look for ways to reduce operational overhead.

Sniptail Cloud is being designed to make that transition straightforward:
- configurations and repo allowlists will map directly
- workflows and chat commands will stay the same
- moving to Cloud will not require changes to how your team uses Sniptail day to day

Using Sniptail Cloud will be optional.
